1337net is an opensource document sharing platform.

How it works: It’ll work sort of like the Internet does. You throw up a “Toaster”, and you “put” the “Waffle” in the “Toaster”. The “Toaster” then sends the “Waffle” a “Heatwave”, for example, a 102 “Document Request” message. Then the “Toaster” will do what it needs to according to the message, and it’ll send a “Heatwave” to the “Waffle”, in this case either a 100 “Document transmission”, a 201 “Not found”, or another “Heatwave”.

Then the “Waffle” does what it should according to the “Toaster”’s "heatwave", and moves on with it’s day.

We can build on this fundamental setup, for example we could build a server-side (eg. PHP) (or even client-side (eg. Javascript) programming language that gets embedded into the page and is interpreted by either the server or client respectively without actual modification to the protocol itself, just the server/client that’s operating on it.
